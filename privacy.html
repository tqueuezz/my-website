            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 30, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Trinity Strategy & Marketing ("we," "our," "us") provides AI assistant, lead capture, and automated messaging services (the "Service") to business clients. The Service may appear on our clients' websites, social media messaging channels, and other communication channels.</p>

            <h2>2. What This Policy Covers</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, share, and protect information when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You interact with an AI assistant or chat widget powered by Trinity Strategy & Marketing, or</li>
                <li>You visit any site, portal, or dashboard we operate under our brand.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are using a chat assistant on one of our clients' websites, please note: we collect information on behalf of that client. In those cases, the client is typically the "business owner" of the data, and we act as a service provider / processor.</p>

            <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We may collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> name, phone number, email, service address/location.</li>
                <li><strong>Chat Content:</strong> the messages you send, including questions, service requests, emergency details, scheduling information, and any other information you choose to provide.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Context:</strong> information about the service you are requesting (for example, "burst pipe in basement," "no heat," "order status," etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> IP address, browser type, device type, timestamps, and usage data related to how you interact with the chat assistant or dashboard.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We may use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide live alerts or notifications to our client's on-call staff (for example, in case of an emergency service request).</li>
                <li>Help our client follow up with you regarding quotes, appointments, scheduling, or customer support.</li>
                <li>Improve the performance, accuracy, and reliability of the AI assistant.</li>
                <li>Maintain security, prevent fraud or abuse, and enforce our terms.</li>
                <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. How We Share Information</h2>
            <p>We may share information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Our Client (the Business You Are Contacting):</strong> Information you provide in the chat is made available to the business you are trying to reach so they can respond to you.</li>
                <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party infrastructure and tools (for example, hosting, alert/notification services, communication platforms, analytics). These parties may process limited data on our behalf to deliver the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>For Legal / Safety Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or legal process; to protect our rights, safety, or property; or to respond to claims regarding misuse of the Service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information to data brokers.</p>

            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We keep chat transcripts and related data for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Service to our client, resolve disputes, maintain business records, or meet legal obligations. Our clients may also retain copies of transcripts for their own records.</p>

            <h2>7. Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Service is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected personal information from a child under 13, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove that information.</p>

            <h2>9. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal information (for example: access, correction, deletion, or limitation of use). To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information in Section 11. We may need to verify your identity before acting on certain requests.</p>
            <p>Because we often act as a service provider to our business clients, we may refer certain requests (such as "delete my info") to the specific business you contacted.</p>

            <h2>10. Third-Party Links and Integrations</h2>
            <p>Our clients may connect the AI assistant to third-party services (for example: scheduling tools, CRM systems, messaging platforms). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. You should review the privacy policies of any business or platform you interact with.</p>

            <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how your information is handled, you can contact:</p>
            <p><strong>Trinity Strategy & Marketing</strong><br>
            Email: <a href="mailto:support@nightshiftdispatch.com">support@nightshiftdispatch.com</a></p>
            <p>(If you are contacting us on behalf of a legal request, please include the business name you were trying to reach and approximate date/time of the conversation.)</p>

            <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top when changes are made. Continued use of the Service after an update means you accept the updated Policy.</p>
